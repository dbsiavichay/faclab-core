# Auth Spec — Faclab Core

JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization. All admin and POS routes require a valid access token. Login and refresh are public.

## Obtaining a token

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"ChangeMe123!"}'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOi...",
    "tokenType": "Bearer",
    "expiresIn": 900
  }
}
```

Send the token on every protected request:

```
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
```

Access tokens expire after `JWT_ACCESS_TTL` seconds (default 900). Refresh via `POST /api/auth/refresh` with `{"refreshToken":"..."}`. The server revalidates the user (role, `is_active`) before reissuing.

## Protecting a new route

```python
from fastapi import Depends
from src.auth.domain.permissions import Permission
from src.auth.infra.dependencies import require_permission

def _setup_routes(self):
    _read = [Depends(require_permission(Permission.PRODUCT_READ))]
    _write = [Depends(require_permission(Permission.PRODUCT_WRITE))]

    self.router.get("", ..., dependencies=_read)(self.list)
    self.router.post("", ..., dependencies=_write)(self.create)
```

Route-level `dependencies=[...]` runs before the handler. If the user is unauthenticated, the dependency raises `PermissionDeniedError("authentication required")` → 403. If the user lacks the permission, it raises `PermissionDeniedError("missing permissions: [...]")` → 403.

## Adding a new permission

1. Add the verb to `Permission` (StrEnum) in `src/auth/domain/permissions.py` under the right module comment.
2. Add it to the role mappings in `PERMISSIONS_BY_ROLE` (or to `_ALL_READS` / `_OPERATOR_PERMS` / `_CASHIER_PERMS` if it fits an existing bundle). `ADMIN` and `MANAGER` receive it automatically (MANAGER via `frozenset(Permission) - {excluded}`).
3. Add unit tests in `tests/unit/auth/test_permissions.py` covering which roles do and do not get the new permission.
4. Apply it to the relevant routers via `Depends(require_permission(...))`.

Tokens carry only `role`; permissions are re-derived on every request via `permissions_for(role)`. You do not need to reissue tokens when mapping changes.

## Production checklist

- `JWT_SECRET` must be set (config `production.py` raises on missing / short secret).
- Seed the first admin: `AUTH_SEED_USERNAME=... AUTH_SEED_EMAIL=... AUTH_SEED_PASSWORD=... python -m src.auth.seed`
- Rotate `JWT_SECRET` invalidates all active tokens (users must log in again).
- Rate limiting on `/api/auth/login` is NOT implemented — put it at the reverse proxy if exposed publicly.
